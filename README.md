Some potentially useful codes


- **Luminosity** calculates the luminosity of stars from their apparent V magnitude, Teff effective temperature, and parallax. If one wants to calculate the intrinsic luminosity, then the V magnitude should be first corrected for extinction. Have a look at my **[G_to_Vmag](https://github.com/vadibekyan/G_to_Vmag)** repository.
